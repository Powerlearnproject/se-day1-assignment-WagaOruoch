Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANSWER:It is the application of systematic, quantifiable and disciplined approach to the development, operation and maintenance of softwares
IMPORTANCE: Facilitates development and innovation of systems that power aspects of our modern life like communication and entertainment 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANSWER:-Development of programming languages that saw rise of languages such as C and Assembly Language
       -Software engineering instated as discipline in the 1960s
       -Advent of structured programming that aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of computer programs

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
       -requirement: involves gathering information and documenting user needs and system requirements 
       -design: involves coming up with a detailed model of the software architecture.
       -implementation: code writing and building the software based on the model design
       -testing: conducts various tests to ensure the software meets quality stanards and system requirements
       -deployment: releasing the software to the customers
       -maintenance: providing support, enhancements and updating the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
       -Comparison: both techniques are well structured in phases to ensure quality software products i.e requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance 
       -Contrast: Agile is iterative and flexible that allows continuous adaptations of consumer feedbacks while waterfall is rigid and linear, completing one phase and moving on to the next, with little room for changes once development begins 
       -Examples:Agile methodologies- developing a healthcare softwares
                 Waterfall- hardware development softwares

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
       -software developer- write codes of the software
       -quality assurance enginner- designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality
       -project manager- overlook planning, execution and delivery of softwares

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
       -IDEs are provide a platform for developers to write, debug and test the software codes. example:Visual studio code 
       -Version Control Systems allows devs to keep track of change made to the source code and coordinate work with the team members. example: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
       -requirement changes: adopt techniques such as agile methodologies that incorporate changes in the development stages 
       -tight deadlines: come up with an optimised plan using the appropriate s/w development techniques that would allow easy coordination
       -technical debt: use appropriate systems and codes in development that gives room for future improvement

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
       unit testing- tests the individual modules or component of the software 
       integration testing- tests the interaction between different component or sub-systems of the software
       system testing- tests the entire software as a whole
       acceptance testing- tests the sofware againt the user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
       prompt engineering is the designing and refining input statements given to AI models, to achieve specified desired output
       It is important because it helps the AI model to understand one's request better and give the desired output 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
       vague prompt: "Tell me about world war 1."
       improved prompt: "Focuing on the history of world war 1, give me information on the years it started and ended, the countries involved as well as the reason and circumstances that led to its declaration"
